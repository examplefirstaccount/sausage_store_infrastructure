# Alertmanager Configuration

This directory contains configuration files and alerting rules for [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/), used to handle alerts generated by Prometheus in the **Sausage Store** project.

## Contents

- `rules.yaml`: Defines custom Prometheus alerting rules.
- `values.yaml`: Helm values used to configure the Alertmanager deployment, including alert routing and receiver setup.

## Alerting Rules

The alert rules in `rules.yaml` monitor the **backend** service and trigger alerts for:

- **InstanceDown**: Backend is not responding.
- **Code500**: HTTP 500 errors.
- **Latency > 100ms**: High latency on POST `/api/orders`.
- **Unexpected status codes**: Alerts on 3xx, 4xx, and 5xx responses from `/actuator/prometheus`.

## Alert Routing

The `values.yaml` configures routing logic and receivers for alerts:

- Alerts with `severity: critical` or `warning` are sent to **Telegram**.
- Grouping delays and intervals are set to avoid alert flooding.

## Telegram Receiver

Alerts are sent to a Telegram chat using a bot:

- **Bot Token**: Preconfigured.
- **Chat ID**: Preconfigured.
- Alerts are formatted using Go templating in the `message` field.

This module is intended to be deployed as part of the Prometheus-Alertmanager monitoring stack for Sausage Store.
